##### What are the inputs for the model?

Options pricing might look a little difficult at the beginning, but actually only a handful of inputs are needed for our simple _plain vanilla_ options.   

This model uses several inputs:  
**Spot Price:** is the current price for the underlying asset.  
**Strike Price:** is the exercise price for the option.  
**Maturity Date:** is the date in which the option expires.  
**Interest Rates:** is the 'risk free' interest rate for the currency our underlying is traded.  
**Dividend Yield:** represents, for a given underlying, the relevant dividend yield.  
**Volatility:** represents the underlying volatility. As a proxy for the 'real' volatility (which is unknown) it is sometimes computed as the annualized Standard Deviation of the underlying price returns.  

##### How to use this App?
First you have to go to the 'Pricer' page. Just use the controls on the left hand side to change the inputs. On the 'Simulation Chart' page you can use the controls on the top to choose the variables for both axis.
