##### What is the meaning of these outputs?

<small>
**premium:** is the value of the option given by the Black-Scholes model. The premium is the sum of both: **intrinsic** value (the value the spot is over the strike for the calls, or below for the puts), and **temporal** value (the value due to the possibility of a favorable price move).  
**delta:** is the expected change in the option price if the 'Spot' price moves by 1 unit. It can be expressed as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to Spot.  
**gamma:** is the expected change in the delta if the 'Spot' price moves by 1 unit. It is the second partial derivative of the BS formula in order to Spot. You case use delta and gamma to predict option price changes due to changes in Spot price. For 1 unit change, it should be about `delta + gamma/2`. Not sure why? Just check [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) about Taylor Series.  
**theta:** represents the expected change in option premium when the time until maturity decreases by one day. It is usually negative for both Calls and Puts.  
**vega:** represents the expected change in option price when volatility changes by 1 percentage point. It can be described as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to Volatility.  
**vanna:** is the second derivative of the option premium, in order to the Spot price and to the Volatility. If helps to explain the change in delta when the volatility changes, or, the change in vega when the price changes.  
**vomma:** is the second derivative of the option premium, twice in odor to volatility. It explains vega change when volatility changes.  
**rho:** represents the expected change in option price when the interest rate changes by 1 percentage point. It can be described as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to the Interest Rate.
