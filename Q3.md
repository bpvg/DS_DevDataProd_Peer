##### What is the meaning of these outputs?

**premium:** is the value of the option given by the Black-Scholes model. The premium is the sum of both: **intrinsic** value (the value the spot is over the strike for the calls, or below for the puts), and **temporal** value (the value due to the posibility of a favourable price move).  
**delta:** is the expected change in the option price if the 'Spot' price moves by 1 unit. It can be expresed as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to Spot.  
**gamma:** is the expected change in the delta if the 'Spot' price moves by 1 unit. It is the second partial derivative of the BS formula in order to Spot. You case use delta and gamma to predict option price changes due to changes in Spot price. For 1 unit change, it should be about `delta + gamma/2`. Not sure why? Just check [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) about Taylor Series.  
**theta:** represents the expected change in option premium when the time until maturity decreases by one day. It is usualy negative for both Calls and Puts.  
**vega:** represents the expected change in option price when volatility changes by 1 percentage point. It can be described as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to Volatility.  
**rho:** represents the expected change in option price when the interest rate changes by 1 percentage point. It can be described as the first partial derivative of the BS function in order to the Interest Rate.
