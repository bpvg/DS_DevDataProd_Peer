##### What is a Financial Option?

A Financial Option as a type of financial instrument which gives his/her owner the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call option) or to sell (put option) a given asset at a given price by a given date.  
Options are commonly used for trading, risk management and hedging purposes.

Lets imagine you own an airline. You might want to protect against a rise in JET A price (or whatever fuel your airplanes use). In this case you can buy a Call option as insurance against price moves. If the price goes up you can exercise your option a buy the fuel below market prices. If the prices go down, you forget about the option and just buy the fuel at market prices.

On the other hand, imagine you own a farm and you produce oranges. You might want to make sure you can sell your production at a given price, even if market prices go down. In this case you can buy a Put option. If the prices go down, you can sell your oranges at the exercise price... Again, if the price goes up, your option is worthless, because you can sell at higher prices in the market.

Of course nothing of this come at zero cost... The other party in the trade will require some premium to sell you the options.
