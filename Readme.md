This app is designed to price European-style Financial Options using the Black-Scholes model. This model was first published by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in their 1973 paper: "_The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities_".  
This work uses an slightly modified model, allowing for a continuous dividend payment to be taken into account for the pricing.
